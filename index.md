# Fingerprint ID Safe with Keypad

The Fingprint ID Safe with keypad is a two step-vertification safe that only unlocks after the right finerprint and right passcode. The biggest triumps is when the keypad worked.

<!--Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

# First Milestone

Hello, my name is Timothy. I am a rising Junior at Redwood High School. My project is the Fingerprint ID and Keypad Safe. This is my first milestone video. My first milestone involves attaching the servo and matrix keypad to the Arduino and writing the code for the servo, matrix keypad, and passwords. The matrix keypad has 12 keys but 8 pins. Each key corresponds to a row and column pin. After testing and research, I was able to connect the matrix keyboard to the digital pins on the Arduino. The row pins on the matrix keypad (R1, R2, R3, R4) connect the digital pins 13, 12, 11, 10 on the Arduino. The column pins on the matrix keypad (C1, C2, C3) connect to the digital pins 9, 8, 7 on the Arduino. I then coded a password checker based on the inputs of the matrix keypad. The servo has 3 colored wires that each stood for a different pin connection on the matrix keypad. The orange wire connects to a digital pin on the Arduino. The red wire connects to the 5V on the power pins. The brown wire connects to a GND wire on the Arduino. Since I only had one motor I didn’t need an external power source because the Arduino had enough power to support the motor. In my code, the setup() method instructs the user to Enter a Password and defines which digital pin contains the servo. Before the setup() method the keypad map and digital pins connecting to the matrix keypad are defined. In my loop() method I used keypad.getKey() to get the input from the matrix keypad. After checking if a key does exist I checked for the value of the key (*, #, password). The “#” is defined to the enter key and the “*” is defined to clear the password the user entered. I wrote some code to check if the password is correct or not and added an increasing delay of 1 second when the password is incorrect. The servo is only turned when the password is entered correctly. After the password is entered correctly, the servo turns 90 degrees counter-clockwise, waits for 7 seconds, then turns 90 degrees clockwise which returns the servo back to its original position. Finally the string for the password is cleared. 


# Starter Project

My starter project is the usless box. When you activate the lever on the top, an arm comes out of the flap in the box to push the lever back in its orginal place. My project contains motor, resistors, arm, control switch, and snap switch. Once the control switch is activated, the arm releases the snap switch and hits the contol switch which allows current to flow backwards. The current moves the arm back to its orginal position. My project also contains a LED, however the LED was soldered on incorrectly and the solder was to little to remove causing the project to not have an LED. 

# Schematics 
<!--
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

# Code

Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs.

Keypad keypad = Keypad( makeKeymap(keys), pin_rows, pin_column, ROW_NUM, COLUMN_NUM );

    else if (key == '#'){ //Checks for # (answer key)
      Serial.println("Password entered");
      if (attempted_passcode == password) { //Check for correct password
        Serial.println("Password correct.");
        attempted_passcode = "";
        //SERVO CODE HERE

        myservo.write(180);
        delay(7000);
        myservo.write(93);

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
